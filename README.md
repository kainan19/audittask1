Audit Task 1

Welcome to my submission of Task 1 for the Audit Course.
You may begin exploring the webpage by running main.html, though running any file first would do the job too.

This project consists of a basic website with specificity of Navigation Bar and Footer modules.

Texts like those in about and terms of use pages have been pulled off from random sample template websites.

I was facing some issues with adding screenshots in a folder. Thus in that light, click on "Create Screenshots" beside the "Screenshots" file, 
and then you can view the screenshots of this particular website as a comment. 
I have also uploaded a PDF with the screenshots in the main folder.
Apologies for this inconvinience.
